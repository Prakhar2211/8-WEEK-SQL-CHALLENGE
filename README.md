### Business Task
Danny is expanding his new Pizza Empire and at the same time, he wants to Uberize it, so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

### Business Task
Danny launched a new initiative, Data Bank which runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn‚Äôt only for banking activities, they also have the world‚Äôs most secure distributed data storage platform!

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help!

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!
